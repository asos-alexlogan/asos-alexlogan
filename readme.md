## hello.

I'm Alex, and i'm an iOS engineer in the iOS A-Team. I've been around here for a couple months.

I've not contributed much yet, but I'm allready hard at work on my first hygiene feature, Siri.

When I'm not at work, i'm either writing on my [blog](https://alexanderlogan.co.uk/blog), or making coffee.

My app [Coffee Book](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/coffee-book/id1512681263), entirely based around my love for coffee, was featured as App of the day.
It serves as a test bed not just for my product ideas, but for tech too, built using SwiftUI.

### The stuff im best at

#### ‚ú® new stuff ‚ú®
Wether its a fancy new piece of tech like the ProMotion display, or the new concurrency code in Swift 5.5, I'm on it.
- Advocate for SwiftUI, having shipped multiple apps to the store with it.
- Proficient in just about everything they announced since WWDC19 ( I was there üò≠ )
    - Compositional Layouts
    - Mac Catalyst
    - WatchOS
    - SwiftUI
    - Concurrency
    - Combine
    - App Clips
    - Widgets
    - Siri 

#### ü§î sharing
Whilst its great for me to know a lot about the ‚ú® new stuff ‚ú®, its no use if everyone else falls behind. I'm always happy to share my knowledge with any team. My passion for my work shines though, and usually spreads to those around me, driving for more contributions from all.
- Spoken at conferences
- Working on CoP presentations
- Always happy to help someone else share

#### ü§ñ cross-platform ( no, not that cross-platform ) üçè
I see myself as an app developer, not an iOS developer. I work hard to stay up to date with Android too, and whilst I cant confess to be a pro, I have managed to get the top spot on the play store with a very neatly developed Kotlin app. It's my opinion that to be the best app developer I can be, I can't just know one platform.
- Experimented with Compose
- Huge fan of coroutines & the view model lifecycle
- Material design advocate

#### üë®üèª‚Äçüé® design
When its not for asos, I design everything myself. I work hard to get the most out of the platforms I work on, with respect for accessibility and the relevant interface guidelines. I'm always happy to chat about design, wether thats to bounce some ideas off me, or just in general!

#### üß† saved items
The majority of my work here has revolved around the saved items area of the app. Whilst i've not been here long, I feel I could happily field questions.

### üëãüèª get in touch

I'm always happy to grab a coffee, wether thats virtual, or when I'm around the office. If you wanna share something cool or ask about something thats great, and if you want to tell me how I can improve, that's great too.
